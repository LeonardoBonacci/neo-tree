It is recommended that it is always explicitly configured, to ensure the system has a balanced configuration. Until then, a JVM computed heuristic of 8539602944 bytes is used instead. If you are running neo4j server, you need to configure dbms.memory.heap.max_size in neo4j.conf. If you are running neo4j embedded, you have to launch the JVM with -Xmx set to a value. You can run neo4j-admin memrec for memory configuration suggestions.
